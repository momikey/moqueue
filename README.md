## Description

Moqueue is a dead simple queue service suitable for use by chatbots (e.g., Nightbot on Twitch). It stores data in JSON files, so it doesn't require any database access. Just a simple shared server should be all you need.

I don't intend to maintain this, so if you'd like to improve on it, feel free. I wrote it for my brother, a streamer, but he doesn't need it, and I don't like my code going to waste.
